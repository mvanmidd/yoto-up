## View and adjust track volumes before upload

This app helps you make sure audio files sound consistent on your Yoto cards. Use the following steps to check each file and make small volume adjustments before uploading.

Who this is for
- Anyone preparing audio to upload to Yoto (parents, teachers, content creators).
- No technical knowledge required — just a few clicks.

Quick overview
- Open the app and add the audio files you want to upload.
- For each file you can view a waveform and listen to a short preview.
- If a file sounds much louder or quieter than the others, use the built-in volume controls to make small adjustments.
- Save the adjusted audio and then upload — the original filenames will be preserved in the card metadata.

Step-by-step

1. Add files
- Drag files into the uploader or use the Add button to pick files from your computer.
- Each file shows as a row with the filename and a few small buttons on the right.

2. Preview the file
- Click Preview to play the file on your computer. This is the fastest way to check loudness.

3. View the waveform
- Click View details (or the waveform icon) to open a larger waveform view.
- The waveform shows where loud and quiet parts are. This helps you spot files that are much quieter or much louder than the rest.

4. Adjust the volume
- If a file is too quiet or loud compared to the others, click the Adjust / Volume button in the file row.
- A simple slider will appear allowing you to change the gain (volume) by small amounts.
- Move the slider and use the Preview button again to confirm how it sounds. Small changes (±1–3 dB) are usually enough.

5. Save the adjusted audio
- After you’re happy with the adjustments, click Save Adjusted Audio for that file.
- The app keeps the original filename for display and for the card metadata so nothing confusing shows up on the device.

6. Upload
- Once you’ve previewed and adjusted all files you want, click Start Upload.
- If you choose to append to an existing card, make sure you select the card first (the app will warn you if no card is selected).

Tips and best practices
- Adjust by small amounts — small dB changes can make a big difference to perceived loudness.
- Prefer consistency over perfection: getting all files to roughly the same loudness is better than making one file perfect.
- Use the waveform and a quick preview together — the waveform shows issues, listening confirms them.

Troubleshooting
- If Preview doesn’t play, check your system audio and ensure the file is not corrupted.
- If you accidentally saved an adjustment you don’t like, re-open the Adjust dialog, reset the slider, and save again.

Where adjustments are recorded
- The app records any gain adjustments in the card metadata so you can see which files were changed and by how much.
